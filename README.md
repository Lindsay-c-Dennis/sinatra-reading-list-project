# Welcome to the Reading List!

This is a sinatra-based web application that allows readers to create a profile and curate their reading list. Users are able to add pre-existing books to their reading list or create new books. They can also view other users' reading lists and view index pages for each author and book.

To use this app: 
  - click the 'clone or download' button to copy link text
  - in your terminal, enter 'git clone (link text)'
  - run rake db:migrate
  - run rake db:seed to populate the library (optional)
  - run shotgun
